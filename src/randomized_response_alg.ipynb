    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we would like to evaluate the proportion of students at a local university who have violated the Honor Code. There are, however, a few concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Students are uncomfortable with sharing the truth.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *The results of the survey are not confidential.* Assume, for instance, that 10 people filled out the survey, and it is known that 20% of respondents put 'Yes (violated).' If you know that 8 respondents put 'No,' then the remaining two people must have put 'Yes.' (Such a concern could also happen directly if I'm not careful and release the data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We would therefore like to maintain sufficient accuracy in estimating the fraction of students who violated the Honor Code while affording **plausible deniability** to survey participants. We develop a **local differential privacy** model by adding random noise to individual survey responses, implemented with the following randomized response algorithm."
